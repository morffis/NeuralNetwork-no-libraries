# NeuralNetwork without libraries
This is a barebones script model to understand each calculation step of a basic neural network.

The goal is to feed foward the input values through a single hidden layer and update its weights to reduce the error with the actual output values.

The inspiration of this script is contained in this [link](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/).
